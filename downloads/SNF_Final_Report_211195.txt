## 2.1. Description of the Scientific Exchange - Activities

Joerg Osterrieder did a research stay at the Department of Mathematics at the American University of Sharjah (AUS) in the UAE, spread over several visits and a time-frame of 15 months. These research trips were focused on two main areas: improving the security of blockchain technology and studying digital assets known as non-fungible token, especially in virtual environments like the Metaverse. Here is a short overview of the work produced during these stays:

1. Understanding Security in Blockchain: They wrote a guide that helps people learn about the challenges in keeping blockchain technology safe from fraud and other security issues. This guide is meant to give readers a basic understanding of how to protect blockchain systems.

2. Advanced Methods for Detecting Fraud in Blockchain: This work, which is still being reviewed, looks into better ways to find and prevent fraud in blockchain networks. The research done at AUS contributed to developing these new methods, aiming to make blockchain technology more secure.

3. Study on Digital Assets in Virtual Worlds (NFTs): Another project under review explores how NFTs work in the Metaverse. This research aims to explain the role of NFTs in virtual environments and how they can change the way we think about owning digital items.

4. Analysis of NFTs in the Metaverse: This study, submitted for publication, investigates the behavior, trends, and economic impact of NFTs in virtual worlds. The work benefits from the collaborative research environment at AUS, providing insights into how NFTs are used and valued.

The cooperation between Prof. Osterrieder and Prof. Chan served as the core for expanding a global network of research collaborations, in the fields of mathematics and blockchain technology. These included engagements with Dr. Yuanyuan Zhang from the University of Manchester, UK, further work with Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Chu at Renmin University, China, a partnership with Prof. Dr. Codruta Mare at Babes-Bolyai University, Romania, and collaboration with Prof. Dr. Branka Hadji Misheva at Bern Business School, Switzerland. The efforts were characterized by deep, constructive dialogues on research methodologies and outcomes, resulting in several joint publications and the exchange of personnel. This network of collaborations, rooted in the initial work at AUS, significantly contributed to advancing research in blockchain technology and related areas.

## 2.2. Description of the Scientific Exchange - Results

The results from the series of studies on blockchain technology, Metaverse, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) provide significant insights into the security, ownership, and market dynamics of digital assets. Here's a concise overview of the findings:

1. Blockchain Anomaly and Fraud Detection: The study offers a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerabilities within blockchain networks, identifying various types of anomalies and frauds. It introduces a range of detection and prevention strategies, including statistical and machine learning methods, game-theoretic solutions, and digital forensics. The research underscores the importance of advanced security measures for maintaining the integrity and reliability of blockchain networks.

2. Metaverse and NFTs: This paper delves into how NFTs within the Metaverse are revolutionizing digital ownership and online economies. It explains the technological underpinnings of the Metaverse and NFTs, highlighting their role in securing digital assets and identities. The study examines the impact of NFTs on digital economies, emphasizing their potential to transform online art, ownership, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

3. Stylized Facts of Metaverse NFTs: Through an empirical analysis of five notable NFTs (AXS, MANA, ENJ, THETA, SAND), this research uncovers stylized facts that characterize market behaviors, pricing mechanisms, and investor dynamics in the Metaverse NFT space. Utilizing advanced statistical methods, the study reveals insights into the complexities of the NFT market, offering valuable information for investors, content creators, and policymakers.

These studies collectively advance our understanding of blockchain security, digital ownership, and the financial implications of NFTs in the Metaverse. They highlight the evolving nature of digital assets and the need for innovative regulatory and strategic approaches to navigate these emerging digital landscapes.
