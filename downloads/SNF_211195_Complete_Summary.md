## Project Abstract

This project explores anomaly and fraud detection in blockchain networks, focusing on challenges due to immutability and unique properties like decentralization. The goal is rapid detection to mitigate damages due to fraudulent activities.

### Background
Blockchain networks are increasingly being implemented into healthcare, supply chain, and retail systems through smart contracts and smart devices. While this technology brings benefits, the immutability property means that fraudulent transactions cannot be easily reversed, making early detection critical.

### Rationale
Blockchains can be attacked via a deluge of requests or transactions within a short time span, resulting in loss of connectivity for users and businesses. Rapid detection of anomalies is critical to prevent damage or correct issues as soon as possible.

### Objectives
- Extend and improve upon the accuracy of existing methods of static anomaly detection through combining methods from statistics and data mining
- Develop a new method for dynamic anomaly detection based on data streams and statistical extreme value theory
- Further the understanding of the sources and behaviors of anomalies and fraud in blockchain-based networks

### Methods
- Static anomaly detection via hybrid approaches
- Dynamic anomaly detection using extreme value theory
- Machine learning, game theory, digital forensics
- Reputation-based systems
- Network graph analysis
