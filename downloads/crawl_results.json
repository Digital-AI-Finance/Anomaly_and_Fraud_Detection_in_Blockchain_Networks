Osterrieder QCAM Currency Asset Management QCAM Currency Asset Management – Cooperation Partner 2017 – 2020 📌 Role Summary From 2017 to 2020, I collaborated with QCAM Currency Asset Management as a cooperation partner, focusing on the quantitative research, development, and implementation of new currency overlay asset management products. 🔍 Technical Responsibilities and Contributions 1. Currency Overlay Strategy Design Developed systematic currency overlay strategies using quantitative models that incorporated both fundamental and technical indicators. Applied factor-based frameworks that integrated carry, momentum, and value signals to capture excess returns in currency markets. Used rolling window regressions and Kalman filter approaches to dynamically estimate time-varying hedge ratios. 2. Signal Construction and Forecasting Constructed short- and medium-term momentum signals using time-series analysis (e.g. ARIMA models, moving averages, and trend-following indicators) to capture directional opportunities. Integrated macroeconomic variables (e.g. interest rate differentials, purchasing power parity) into mean-reversion signals to identify over- and undervalued currencies. Applied cointegration techniques to detect long-term equilibrium relationships between currency pairs, supporting relative value trades. 3. Risk Management Integration Developed dynamic position-sizing models based on rolling volatility and conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to manage tail risks and drawdowns. Conducted scenario analysis using historical stress periods (e.g. 2008 crisis, 2011 eurozone crisis) to validate model robustness under different market conditions. Integrated liquidity filters to adjust position sizes and execution strategies during low-liquidity periods. 4. Backtesting and Performance Evaluation Implemented rigorous backtesting frameworks using historical spot and forward rate data, accounting for transaction costs and slippage. Used walk-forward testing and rolling performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown) to ensure out-of-sample robustness. Evaluated strategy performance across different market regimes to validate consistency and stability. 5. Portfolio Construction and Optimization Integrated currency overlay signals into multi-asset portfolio optimization frameworks. Applied mean-variance and risk-parity approaches to balance currency risk against underlying asset exposures. Modeled currency correlation matrices and stress-tested portfolio sensitivity to exchange rate shocks. 🤝 Collaboration Highlights Worked closely with QCAM’s quantitative research team to ensure models met operational and regulatory requirements. Contributed to integrating the models into QCAM’s investment platforms, ensuring consistency with compliance frameworks and risk management standards. 📈 Achievements and Outcomes Delivered quantitative currency overlay strategies that enhanced portfolio diversification and reduced currency risk. Developed dynamic risk management frameworks that improved drawdown control and performance stability. Contributed to the design of new currency overlay products that offered clients systematic, rules-based exposure to currency markets. ✅ Summary My work with QCAM Currency Asset Management focused on designing and implementing systematic currency overlay strategies using traditional quantitative models. Through rigorous backtesting, risk management integration, and collaboration with the QCAM research team, I contributed to the development of innovative currency asset management products that improved portfolio efficiency and risk control.

Useful for teaching and internal research teams alike.\" — Reviewer, European asset management firm \"Balanced, well-structured, and technically grounded. A valuable reference for anyone working in systematic finance.\" — Academic peer review, SSRN Content Chapter 1 – Technical Introduction and Conceptual Framework Chapter 1 lays the theoretical and methodological foundation for the integration of machine learning (ML) into asset management, highlighting the shift from traditional parametric models to flexible, data-driven learning systems. It positions ML not as a replacement for financial theory, but as a complementary analytical framework that expands the capacity to model complex, nonlinear relationships in financial data. Core Concepts Problem Formulation : The chapter outlines key ML tasks relevant to asset management, such as classification (e.g., price direction prediction), regression (e.g., return forecasting), and policy learning (e.g., portfolio allocation under uncertainty), mapped to corresponding financial decision problems. Modeling Paradigm : Emphasizes predictive modeling over explanatory modeling, where generalization error minimization replaces hypothesis testing as the guiding principle. Function Approximation : ML models are introduced as universal approximators f(x;θ)≈yf(x; \\theta) \\approx yf(x;θ)≈y, where the focus shifts from structural assumptions to empirical risk minimization using historical data. Data Structure : Discusses the types of financial data used (cross-sectional, time-series, panel), and the challenges posed by non-stationarity, noise, high dimensionality, and structural breaks. Framework and Scope Learning Algorithms : Previews the methodological coverage of the book, including supervised learning (e.g., logistic regression, trees, SVMs), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, PCA), and reinforcement learning (e.g., policy gradients, Q-learning). Evaluation Metrics : Introduces key performance criteria such as classification accuracy, AUC, Sharpe rati"

Osterrieder MAN AHL Man Investments – AHL TargetRisk Strategy Quantitative Research & Portfolio Management Pfäffikon, Switzerland | Nov 2012 – Dec 2014 Role Overview From November 2012 to December 2014, I was responsible for quantitative modeling, Python programming, and implementation of the AHL TargetRisk strategy at Man Investments. This involved systematic approaches to multi-asset investing, focusing on dynamic risk management and volatility targeting. Strategy Overview The AHL TargetRisk is a systematic, dynamic, multi-asset allocation strategy designed to manage risk actively while achieving stable, long-term returns. It dynamically allocates across equities, credit, government bonds, commodities, and inflation-linked instruments, adapting its portfolio based on market conditions, volatility, and correlation signals. Specific Contributions & Technical Details Quantitative Modeling : Developed systematic allocation methods using Python, emphasizing volatility targeting, risk budgeting, and correlation monitoring. Python Programming : Created automated rebalancing and execution scripts using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. Built extensive backtesting frameworks in Python for parameter optimization, stress testing, and historical scenario analysis. Developed Python-based dashboards for real-time risk analytics, including VaR, expected shortfall, and volatility measures. Risk Management Techniques : Implemented volatility scaling to systematically control portfolio volatility at the asset-class and portfolio levels. Integrated momentum overlays to reduce exposures proactively during market downturns. Developed correlation overlays to manage and mitigate losses during bond-driven market sell-offs, employing advanced volatility models (e.g., the HEAVY model). Achievements and Impact Successfully supported the live launch of AHL TargetRisk in December 2014, adhering strictly to the strategy's volatility target (~10%). Demonstrated robust performance, achieving notable risk-adjusted returns with lower drawdowns compared to traditional benchmarks: Annualized return : 9.2% (versus 2.9% for the Morningstar Moderate Allocation index). Annualized volatility : 7.8%. Sharpe ratio : 1.06, significantly higher than peer benchmarks. Contributed directly to the strategy's recognition and its continuing use in institutional portfolios, where it manages billions in assets. Strategy Performance Highlights Systematic Multi-Asset Allocation : Broad diversification across global markets, dynamically balanced based on quantitative signals. Enhanced Return Profile : Strategic volatility targeting and momentum overlays resulted in lower drawdowns and smoother returns, validated by quantitative analysis and simulated performance studies. Active Risk Controls : Advanced models helped the portfolio to proactively adjust risk exposure, significantly reducing volatility spikes during turbulent periods. Current Market Recognition The AHL TargetRisk strategy holds a high industry reputation, recognized by a Morningstar \"Gold\" analyst rating for its sophisticated systematic approach and performance consistency. Summary of Quantitative Results (Simulated & Live) 📊 Performance Highlights The AHL TargetRisk Strategy has demonstrated strong performance compared to a traditional 60/40 benchmark portfolio across key metrics: Annualized Return: AHL TargetRisk: 13.0% 60/40 Benchmark: 7.1% Annualized Volatility: AHL TargetRisk: 7.8% 60/40 Benchmark: ~10% Maximum Drawdown: AHL TargetRisk: -15.9% 60/40 Benchmark: -32.1% Sharpe Ratio: AHL TargetRisk: 1.08 60/40 Benchmark: 0.51 Performance metrics are derived from simulated and historical data.

Osterrieder Bank of America Merrill Lynch Bank of America Merrill Lynch – Global Markets Division Associate, Quantitative Research & Algorithmic Trading London, UK | April 2007 – March 2009 📌 Role Summary Between April 2007 and March 2009, I worked as an Associate in the Global Markets Division at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. My role focused on supporting quantitative research, developing algorithmic execution strategies, and enhancing transaction cost analysis frameworks. I contributed to global trading strategies by applying advanced modeling, programming, and statistical techniques. 🔍 Deeper Technical Breakdown 1. Market Microstructure Analysis Conducted tick-level data analysis to model order book dynamics, including spread behavior, queue position, and limit order book resiliency. Applied frameworks such as the square-root law to estimate market impact and optimize execution algorithms (e.g., adjusting child order size dynamically based on predicted short-term liquidity and volatility). Modeled short-term price impact and transient impact decay using autoregressive models to inform order slicing logic. 2. Advanced Execution Modeling Developed volume profile models using historical and intraday data to forecast expected volume curves (e.g., u-shaped profiles) and adjust execution schedules. Applied Implementation Shortfall decomposition : Delay Cost : Measured slippage due to order queue position and time-to-execution. Market Impact : Estimated cost per unit of liquidity taken. Opportunity Cost : Calculated risk-adjusted performance loss from incomplete fills. Integrated these models into execution strategies, refining VWAP and IS algorithms to dynamically adapt to live market conditions. 3. Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) Development Built robust TCA frameworks to evaluate fill performance, slippage, and adverse selection. Implemented regression-based models to control for trade size, volatility, and spread dynamics, enabling fair benchmarking of execution quality across desks and venues. Automated data pipelines (Python, SQL) to collect, clean, and process execution logs for real-time analysis and post-trade reporting. 4. Programming and Technology Integration Used Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy) for prototyping analytical models, performance reports, and scenario analysis. Collaborated with technology teams to integrate models into production systems using Java and proprietary trading frameworks. Developed real-time monitoring dashboards to track algorithm performance metrics such as slippage, fill rates, and volume participation. 5. Strategy Adaptation and Stress Testing Conducted stress testing using historical market data (e.g., 2008 financial crisis scenarios) to evaluate algorithm robustness under high volatility and reduced liquidity. Integrated dynamic participation rate logic to manage execution risk in thinly traded markets or periods of high volatility. 🤝 Collaborations (2007–2009) During this time, I worked closely with several key experts: Jim Gatheral – Authority on volatility modeling and market microstructure.
